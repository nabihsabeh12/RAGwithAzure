Good value - Clean and Convenient
The Kensington Hotel, Oslo
3/4/2018
I stayed two nights here and considered it good value for money. I'd certainly stay there again.I've stayed in several budget/tourist hotels in London over the years, and this was definitely one of the better ones. My (single) room was spotlessly clean, with a flat screen TV and new bathroom. It was on the small side but this is to be expected in London budget hotels. One of it's little quirks was that I had to run the shower for a couple of minutes to get hot water in the morning. The odd thing was that the hot water in the sink came on straight away! My room was at the back on the third floor so noise from outside wasn't a problem, although I noticed that the walls were pretty thin - I could hear the people next door if they raised their voices.The Breakfast area was bright and recently decorated. Breakfast consisted of juices, teabags and instant coffee, cereal, white and brown sliced pan (toasters available), croissants, cheese, fruit and some tempting pastries.The location is not bad, just off the Cromwell Road. It's a few minutes walk away from Gloucester Road and Earl's Court Tube Stations. The Natural History Museum, Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museums are a 10-15 min. walk away. Hyde Park is a little further.
