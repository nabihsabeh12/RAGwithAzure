Comfortable but Quirky
The Buckingham Hotel, New York City
1/28/2018
Arrival is a little bizarre because there are no visible signs to lead you to the reception but a number of entrances to chose from. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful as you would expect in any Taj property. Our suite was spacious although the bedroom was small in comparison to the living area. In addition good sized bathroom and kitchen with every utensil you could possibly require. This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in and we were not woken by any of the usual early morning noises one expects from a city or other guests. The only criticism I could have is that there was a draft in the bathroom and the breakfast room / bar is far too small. If you want a quiet stay in a very central part of London then this is an ideal place to stay.
Some notable facilities are: sofa, TV, hot-shower bath
