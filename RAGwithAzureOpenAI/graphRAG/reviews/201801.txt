Average place - great location
The Creek Hotel, Dubai, UAE
1/3/2018
I stayed here twice last year; room was booked by a company I was doing business with in DXB.First
of all, the hotel is in a great location in the middle of Bur Dubai. Lots of shopping nearby, many
restaurants, relatively close to the Creek, easy to get taxis. Within walking distance to a lot. Not sure
of how easy it is to get to now (due to construction, etc). But not bad in last year.The hotel is one of
the older places in Dubai, and looks it. Kind of like a 1970s Holiday Inn that has not been updated.
Reception was efficient, if a bit indifferent. The porter was good. I had a one BR once and a one BR
suite once. Both were clean, if a bit worn. About what you'd expect from an older 3*. No problems
with housekeeping; clean sheets and linens. The one BR had a bed, OK mattress, dresser, desk and
nightstand. The suite had a BR (just about the same as the one BR) and a good sized living room with
sofas, chairs, table, etc. Nice size for the price, actually. Furnishings were OK, on a par with other 2/3
* places. Not up to the standards of upper level places, but a lot cheaper too.The hotel has an
interesting mix of customers; lots of businessmen and a few tourists. Lots of business (cargo
transfer, meetings, etc) going on in the lobby during the day.The hotel restaurant was OK; nothing
spectacular, but not bad either. The pub - which claims to be one of the first in Dubai - was pretty
good. I did not use the pool or other facilities, so I can't comment on how good/not good they
are.Overall, an average place for the price, especially if you're in Dubai for business or are on a
budget. Nice location, OK rooms, fair service.

Some notable facilities are: sofa, TV, hot-shower bath
