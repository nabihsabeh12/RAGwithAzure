great little hotel
The Deira Hotel, Beijing
3/13/2018
We were on the road from Oman to Dubai when we were told we were being moved to this hotel. A quick look at trip advisor convinced us to give it a try although we could have gone to our original hotel.The hotel is near Dubai Creek just off Al Maktoom Road and quite near the airport. Like most things in Dubai you'll need a taxi to get from A to B. The hotel got us a private car service which we used during our stay. A little more expensive but worth it.The rooms are large and comfortable. We had two rooms for the family (girls 3 and 5) but really only needed one. The hotel has 3 restaurants with one being a good Japanese one which requires a reservation. Breakfast was included in the room rate and this was of an acceptable if unspectacular standard.The staff were very friendly and treated us well. They were particularly good to our children which made the stay more enjoyable. Overall this was a great hotel to stay in and a welcome change from the chain hotel experience. It's nothing special in terms of quality and would be around a 2-3 star effort but would certainly stay there again.
